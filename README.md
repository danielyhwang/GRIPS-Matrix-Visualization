# GRIPS 2025 Berlin Project: SymLab Matrix Visualization Tool
## Authors: Daniel Hwang (Georgia Institute of Technology), Kathy Mo (University of California, Los Angeles), Sonali Prajapati (Ludwig Maximillian University of Munich)

## Synopsis
The goal of this project is to create a tool that visualizes matrices, more specifically, constraint matrices associated with MIPS, and extracts useful information/patterns from them.

## Tools Used
PyQt, PySciPoPT, Scipy, Numpy.

## Acknowledgements
Our mentors this summer were Mohammed Ghannam, Gioni Mexi, and Liding Xu of Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB). The authors of this repository acknowledge funding from IPAM (US participants) and MODAL (EU participants) for the summer, along with ZIB for their gracious hospitality.

### Internal notes (on `pyside6-designer` and `pyside6-project` - results saved in designer_test)
- Project was generated by using `pyside6-project new-ui`.
- The commands on the website are broken. If you ever need to make a new project from scratch, try running `pyside6-project build` and then `pyside6-project run` (don't put file names, it messes things up) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62697494/python-qt-no-module-named-ui-mainwindow
- This allows you to run `pyside6-designer` and take advantage of its drag and drop UI design!
- Also look into pyside6-project, it will build and deploy for you.
- Note to self: It's very hard to add custom functionality to these components, at least automatically.
- It seems the intended functionality is to allow you to create a drag and drop file, after which you can convert it into a file meant for use.
- In other words, designer is a template designer NOT meant for actual programming use.

### Other internal notes (setup)
- requirements.txt contains the list of packages needed for this project. You can install this list by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can generate this list by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` on your venv.

This is a test edit.
